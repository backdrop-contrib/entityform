# Entityform

The Entityform module enables you to create front-end forms (fieldable
entities), which contain fields that can be defined. These forms use the
standard Backdrop fields. This means that out of the box, the user can use any
standard Backdrop node field.

## Dependencies

- Entity UI
- Entity Plus

No dependency, but recommended, especially if you're using this module in
combination with Rules: [Entity Tokens](https://backdropcms.org/project/entity_token)

Note that submodule entityform_notifications requires Rules and hence also
entity_token.

## Installation

- Install this module using the
  [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules)

## Configuration

1. Go to Structure > Entityform Types (admin/structure/entityform_types) and "Add an Entityform Type".
2. Select manage fields tab and add the desired fields
3. Select manage displays tab and adapt as needed
4. You can now preview the form and permitted roles can submit values
